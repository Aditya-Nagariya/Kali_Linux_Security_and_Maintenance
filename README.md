# Kali Linux Security Maintenance Script

## Overview

The **Ultimate Kali Linux Security Maintenance Script** is an automated, comprehensive tool designed for maintaining and securing Kali Linux systems. It performs a variety of essential tasks, including:

- **System Updates & Upgrades:** Automatically updates and upgrades system packages.
- **Dependency Fixes:** Checks and fixes broken dependencies.
- **Security Tools Installation:** Installs tools such as RKHunter, ChkRootkit, ClamAV, and more.
- **System Log Cleanup:** Clears outdated logs to free up disk space.
- **Virus Database Updates & Scans:** Updates ClamAVâ€™s virus database and performs multi-threaded scans with animated progress feedback.
- **Security Scans:** Runs RKHunter and ChkRootkit scans.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Checks disk space and current system resource usage.

The script emphasizes visual feedback with dynamic progress bars, spinners, and colorful output, making long maintenance tasks more engaging. It also includes robust logging and error handling, ensuring that all operations are documented for later review.

## Features

- **Dynamic Progress Bar Animation:**  
  Provides real-time visual feedback with percentage completion, spinners, and elapsed time.
  
- **Comprehensive Logging:**  
  All output is saved to a log file (e.g., `/var/log/security_maintenance/security_scan_<timestamp>.log`) with timestamps.

- **Interactive User Menu:**  
  Allows selection between different scan intensities (Light, Medium, Deep) based on the desired thoroughness.

- **Full Disclaimer and Warning:**  
  Displays a detailed disclaimer and warning directly in the terminal, requiring user acknowledgement before proceeding.

- **Graceful Cleanup:**  
  Includes signal traps to clean up background processes if the script is interrupted.

- **Multi-threaded Scanning:**  
  Automatically uses `clamdscan` (if available) for a faster, multi-threaded ClamAV scan, otherwise falls back to `clamscan` with multiscan.

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System:**  
  Kali Linux or any Debian-based system.

- **Root Privileges:**  
  The script must be run with root privileges (e.g., using `sudo`).

- **Dependencies:**
  - `bash`, `tee`, and standard Unix utilities.
  - **Optional:** `figlet` (for enhanced ASCII banners).
  - Security packages: `clamav`, `clamav-daemon`, `rkhunter`, `chkrootkit`, etc.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aditya-Nagariya/kali-security-maintenance.git && cd kali-security-maintenance
   

2. **Make the Script Executable:**
   bash
   chmod +x security_maintenance.sh
   

## Usage

Run the script as root:
bash
sudo ./kali_security_maintenance.sh


Upon execution, you will see a full-screen disclaimer and warning message. **You must press Enter to acknowledge** the disclaimer before any maintenance operations begin.

### User Interaction

- **Disclaimer Acknowledgement:**  
  The script displays a comprehensive disclaimer and warning directly in the terminal. This ensures that users understand the risks involved before proceeding.

- **Scan Intensity Selection:**  
  The script offers three scan modes:
  - **Light Scan:** Critical areas only (faster).
  - **Medium Scan:** System and important directories.
  - **Deep Scan:** Full system scan (most thorough).

- **Dynamic Progress Feedback:**  
  Each maintenance task features a dynamic progress bar that visually displays task progress, percentage completion, and elapsed time.
